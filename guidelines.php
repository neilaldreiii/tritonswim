                            The TRITON program is separated into practice groups providing individual training for competitive swimmers five years of age and older. Placement into groups is by recommendation of the coach during a try-out and trainings. Each group is designed to benefit swimmers who are grouped together by ability. The frequency, duration, and training intensity of practices define each group.

                           The TRITON Swim Team offers a year-round swim program. During school year, the team practices in Metro Naga Sport Complex (Pacol) and during the summer and morning swim at Civic Center pool.

                            In rare instances since the pool is shared with other swim teams, practice times are subject to change based on pool availability. Alternate practice locations may be required at times and will be announced on the team FB or Group Chat. No adjustments in monthly fees are made for the loss of pool time when that loss is outside the control of TRITON.

                            <span class="mrg"></span>The greatest contribution you can make to your swimmer’s progress is to be a loving, supportive parent. First of all, a parent’s role is to supply encouragement, mental and moral support.

                            Parents are welcome at practice. The coaches’ attention needs to be focused on the swimmers during practice.

                            The coach’s job is to motivate and constructively criticize the swimmer’s performance. It is the parent’s job to supply the love, recognition, and encouragement necessary to make the child work harder in practice, which in turn gives him/her the confidence to perform well in competition. Each of our coaches has a different style of coaching. Some coaches are loud and some are quiet. No matter their style, they are seeking to motivate your swimmer to reach for their full potential.

                            Please make every effort to have your swimmers at practice on time. Realize that your child is working hard and give all the support you can. Encourage good diet and sleeping habits. They will serve your children well.

                           <span class="mrg"></span>To have a successful program there must be understanding and cooperation among parents, swimmers, and coaches. The progress your child makes depends to a great extent on this triangular relationship.

                            The following guidelines will help you keep your child’s development as an athlete in the proper perspective and help your child reach his/her full potential under the coach's direction.

                            Ten and Under: Ten and under are the most inconsistent swimmers and this can be frustrating for parents, coaches and the swimmer alike! Parents and coaches must be patient and permit these youngsters to learn to love the sport. When a young swimmer first joins, there may be a brief period in which he/she appears to slow down. This is a result of the added concentration on stroke technique, but this will soon lead to much faster swims for the individual.

                            Even the very best swimmer will have meets where they do not do their best times. These “plateaus” are a normal part of swimming. Over the course of a season, times should improve. Please be supportive of these “poor” meets. The older swimmers may have only two or three meets a year for which they will be rested and tapered.

                            Sportsmanlike behavior and improved performance are of equal importance. All the coaches teach swimmers how to behave like champions whether the swimmers have a “good” or a “bad” swim. Respect for officials, congratulations to other competitors, encouragement to teammates, determined effort, and mature attitudes are examples of great behavior.

                            A swimmer should be praised for improving his/her stroke or time. It is the coach’s job to offer constructive criticism of a swimmer’s performance. It is the parent’s responsibility to provide love and encouragement that bolster the swimmer’s confidence along the way. Swimmers are taught to set realistic, yet challenging goals for meets and to relate those goals to practice to direct their training efforts. Swimmers are prepared and encouraged to compete in all swimming events, distances, and strokes. This promotes versatility and encourages the swimmer to explore his potential in the wide range of events offered in competitive swimming. Often times, a swimmer’s “best” stroke changes as they mature and his/her body goes through physical changes.

                            When swimmers join TRITON, or when current swimmers are looking to advance to a higher practice level, the coaches will determine what level each swimmer should be in. All swimmers are placed in groups based on their ability. In addition, consideration will be given to the swimmer’s maturity level as well as his/her ability to be successful in a particular group.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Testing periods are spread throughout the year to allow swimmers time to advance and improve through the year. Once a swimmer enters the program, testing will only be done at predetermined intervals throughout the swim season.

                            The four competitive strokes are <b>(1) freestyle, (2) backstroke, (3) breaststroke, and (4) butterfly.</b> Events are held in all of the competitive strokes at varying distance depending on the age group of the swimmer. In addition, there is a combination of the strokes swum by one swimmers call the individual medley. The order of the individual medley is butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, and freestyle. Other swimming events include relays, which are a group of four swimmers who either all swim freestyle (freestyle relay) or each swims one of the competitive strokes in the order of backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly and freestyle (medley relay).

                                    Other than the SEA games Trials and the World Championships Trials, each of which is held every four years, the highest level of competition for senior swimmers is the PHILIPPINE National Championships. Any swimmer meeting the national qualifying time standards travel to various cities throughout the PH to compete against Philippines best swimmers. Swimmers can qualify for national teams that represent the PH in international competition by their performance at this meet.
