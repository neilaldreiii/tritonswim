                        <li>All parents have unlimited access to coaches and the Triton officials. Triton takes all parental complaints and concerns seriously. If any parent – or swimmer – has concerns, they should bring those concerns immediately to officers. This includes concerns over inappropriate behavior of any kind.</li>
                        <li>
                            The Officers will investigate all concerns. Depending on the nature of the allegation, the Board may immediately suspend or terminate the coach (or other alleged offending person) and report the incident to the Naga City Police Department for a more thorough investigation. It will also report the incident to Naga City Swimming and PH Swimming for investigation and follow-up.
